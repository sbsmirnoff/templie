Example of an input file:

This part of the script (the part that comes before the first section) is
entirely ignored by Templie. You can use it for whatever purpose you wish.

The rest of the file is split into sections. Each section starts with the
section's name inside square brackets (e.g. [Template]) and continues till
the end of the file or the start of the next section, whichever comes first.

Sections can appear in any order and have any names. However, one specific
section called CONFIG is required. It contains the information about which
sections are to be used by the interpreter (see the example below):

1. 'template' is the name of a template section to be used.
2. 'global_parameters' is the name of a section containing global parameters
3. 'repeater_parameters' is the name of a CSV structured repeater parameter
   section (comma, semicolon and whitespace can be used as delimiters).
   Each line in this section except the first one will produce a new copy
   of a text generated from the template. The first line of this section
   is a list of parameter names.

'#' character is used for comments: all characters between '#' and the end of
the line are ignored by the interpreter. However, in the template sections
comments are disabled, this way '#' character could be included in the template text.

Here is the actual input data:

[CONFIG]                                               # Manadatory CONFIG section

template = Template_A                                  # The name of a template section to be used
global_parameters = PARAMETERS                         # The name of a global parameter section to be used
repeater_parameters = REPEATER                         # The name of a CSV parameter section to be used

[Template]                                             # This is a template section.
This is a global parameter: ${global_parameter_1}
This is another global parameter: $global_parameter_2, but this one is a repeater: ${number}.
First name: $first_name, last name: ${last_name}
Comments do not work in the template section: #####

[Template_A]                                           # This is another template section
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE (ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID)
VALUES (SEQ_EMPLOYEE.nextval, '$first_name', '${last_name}', (SELECT ID FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE NAME = '$department'));

[PARAMETERS]                                           # A global parameter section

global_parameter_1 = "first parameter"                 # If the parameter's value contains whitespace, surround it
                                                       # by double quotes
global_parameter_2 = SECOND_PARAMETER

department = Sales

[REPEATER]                                             # A repeater (CSV) parameter section

number   first_name                   last_name        # List of parameter names
