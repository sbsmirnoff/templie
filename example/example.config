This part of the script, which comes before the first section, is entirely
ignored by Templie. You can use it for whatever purpose you wish.

The rest of the file is split into sections. Each section starts with the
section's name inside square brackets (e.g. [Template]) and continues till
the end of the file or the start of the next section, whichever comes first.

Sections can appear in any order and can have any name. However, one section
called CONFIG is required. It contains the information about which sections
are to be used by the interpreter.

# character is used for comments: all characters between # and the end of
the line are ignored by the interpreter.

This is a global parameter: ${global_paramere_1}
This is another global parameter: $global_paramere_2, but this one is a repeater: ${number}.
First name: $first_name, last name: ${last_name}
